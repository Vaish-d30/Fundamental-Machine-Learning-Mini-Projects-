# Fundamental Machine Learning Mini-Projects

Welcome to the "Fundamental Machine Learning Mini-Projects" repository. This repository contains five essential machine learning projects, each designed to tackle a specific problem using different datasets sourced from the YBI Foundation GitHub page. These projects serve as an excellent starting point for understanding and applying machine learning techniques.

## Projects Overview

1. **Cancer Prediction**
   - **Objective:** Predict whether a patient has cancer based on various medical attributes.
   - **Dataset:** Sourced from YBI Foundation.

2. **Chance of Admission Prediction**
   - **Objective:** Predict the likelihood of a student's admission to a university based on their profile.
   - **Dataset:** Sourced from YBI Foundation.

3. **Purchase Prediction and Numerosity**
   - **Objective:** Predict if a customer will make a purchase based on their profile and past behavior.
   - **Dataset:** Sourced from YBI Foundation.

4. **Fish Weight Prediction**
   - **Objective:** Predict the weight of a fish based on its species and physical measurements.
   - **Dataset:** Sourced from YBI Foundation.

5. **Credit Card Default Prediction**
   - **Objective:** Predict whether a customer will default on their credit card payment.
   - **Dataset:** Sourced from YBI Foundation.

## Dataset

All datasets used in these projects are sourced from the [YBI Foundation GitHub page](https://github.com/ybi-foundation). Each dataset is preprocessed and ready for use in the respective machine learning models.
